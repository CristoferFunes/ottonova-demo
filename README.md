# Ottonova Challenge
## Description
This project showcases a couple of demos for a website. It aims to demonstrate the animation triggers and the requested form for the challenge
You can navigate through the demos just by scrolling in the main page.

## Demos

**Demo 1: Requested Demo**
Description: It's a simple form as it was requested in the challenge, I tried to mimic the aesthetics from the main ottonova webside, but tried to keep it
minimalistic so that the functionality from the requirements remains the main focus:
https://www.ottonova.de/
I used Javascript as requested, you can see that the gender selection triggers the waving animation

**Demo 2: An UI alternative**
Description: It's a second proposal, that has more aesthetic elements on the form, still using the colors and tried to match a bit the look and feel from the main
ottonova website, but this time I focused more on the design.

**Note:**
Website is still not optimized for mobile browsers
